		<strong>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Ok so stale potato chip here; let's make the analogy about the tranquillizer gun that shot Harambe, Oh wait it was an actual rifle :(. (Warning I've played too call of duty on PS3) 
		Continuing on the metal and all actual structures from the firing pin to the barrel of the rifle is all HTML, the different parts of the gun including every little spring in the gun
		are all "tags" that html has in it. These tags can be individually stylized with cool little aesthetics. I.e. there's a nice blue paint on the grip of the rifle and it's got tape wrapped around it too.
		In this analogy all the aesthetic add-ons are the CSS properties that is applied to the HTML elements. <em>Rest in peace Harambe, we should have used tranquillizer darts.</em>

		<strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones):</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls are executed or evaluated. The order of functions and statements matters
		for most programming languages, understanding it's syntax and what's best for what situation is vital. An example could be your daily routine, you wouldn't go about
		your day the following way: 8am: Have dinner => 9am: Get dressed for work => 10am: Go to sleep => 4pm: Wake up and go to work. => 12am: Have breakfast. While certainly
		you can do this, and it could be useful for a specific job that required you to work from 4pm-12am, and you weirdly like to sleep in your work clothes.  What I'm trying
		to say is order impacts the running of your code that is simply what control flow is in a nutshell and while best practices are optimal for most scenarios understanding
		what your order does to your code is optimal for ensuring your website runs as intended.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Loops are pretty simple to explain. I'm gonna use the microwave to describe this one.  When you're cooking food in a microwave it loops through each and every particle
		of food and heats them up every second. Repeating again and again and, you guessed it, again. The microwave will stop when the stop condition, the timer is reached.
		In programming loops it's quite similar. You have to set an initial value for the loop, a condition that the loop continues to check against,
		this condition will be used to evaluate when to stop doing the task. I.e. stop heating the food in the microwave, You really don't want to leave food in there for 30+ minutes.
		Sometimes when loops are executed without stop conditions you can get in quite the predicament and have the entirety of your code come to a halt. Pro Tip: have an ending-condition.

		<strong>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Ok so no more analogies, this one is important folks. The Document Object Model, is the single most useful interface that you will come across for building web pages.
		It can be heavily manipulated by JavaScript on demand to make your websites incredibly interactive. I personally prefer using JavaScript commands to interact with the DOM
		but there are plenty of API's that use the DOM. Extra little point is learn to use DevTools from Chrome, it simplifies and heavily saves time when it comes to tinkering with a website to git it just right.

		<strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Ok these two are pretty different to each other. An array is a collection of a data type (or mixed data types) which are stored in a single 'list' like variable.
		Objects are a representation of a type of instance of a class, this can get pretty hard to describe but they're great, I promise. An example of an Object Class could be a Tree,
		now let's pretend to grow a tree. *poof* now you have a tree named "Steve", now Steve the tree is an instance of that class, and Steve has properties that further describe himself compared 
		to other object and even trees. Steve leaves are green and pointy, his bark is tough and hard. That analogy might do more justice to explain it than just definitions. 
	</p><br>
	
	<p><strong><em>Accessing Arrays:</strong></em></p>
	
	<p>
		When you access data from arrays you either will want to know what you're looking for exactly or the index location of where it would be in the array. #References are great too.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>Accessing Objects:</strong></em></p>
	
	<p>
		You would want to know the property you are looking for but that might not be enough. You may want to utilize accessors and mutators in order to get data that you can't access otherwise.
		Objects are designed with limited data withdrawal and modifications in mind often. The reasons to limit data transfer is because you can break objects, rendering them unusable,
		if you modify some essential properties.
	</p><br>

	<p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful:</strong></p>
	
	<p>
		Functions are better than anything, better than your best friends. It's F stands for family. Seriously though making a function is great to solve problems because
		it's a reusable part of the code that you can just send and/or get data from. Designed properly they execute tasks for you quickly, efficiently and without any hassle, saving lines of code too!
