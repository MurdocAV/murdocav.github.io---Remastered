  <h1>Approaches to Problem Solving</h1>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		There are multiple methods to solve problems, both progarming and non programming related. 
	</p>
  <p>
    Before we discuss specific ones lets have a look at general problem solving. Initially thinking about how you will solve the problem is a solid first step. That being said, if you can't tackle the problem head on a highly recommended method for programmers would be to break it down into a smaller problem. Doing so helps one to start and make progress and figure out how to actually execute big picture functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few different methods that you can utilize are:<br><br>
    <strong><em>Reflecting on your problem solving process:</strong></em><br>
    Doing so helps one understand the problem and can cement knowledge in your head, it's useful for finding out what you're doing if you get lost and confused.<br><br>
    <strong><em>Console.logging:</strong></em><br>
    This one is a personal favourite of mine since it's very easy to do with code that's being said, if you write out pseudo code and create test functions that can often yield. For smaller tests console.logging is perfect. It is useful, but if you try test large chunks of code with it you are bound to get confused.<br><br>
    <strong><em>Reding Error Messages:</strong></em><br>
    This one is incredibly obvious. I've found that with time and learning an error message,once you learn to understand them, gives you quite of information to solve your problem if needed. The type of error is incredibly important and using something node.js tells you a lot about where and what the error was.<br><br>
    <strong><em>The Rubber Ducky Method:</strong></em><br>
    This is method is great, it sounds a bit peculiar. But the entire debugging method is based off the idea that simply describing a problem out loud increases your chance of spotting inconsistencies in your work. If you say something out loud you might realise that you meant one thing and did another and that is amazing when you've spent hours on a problem trying to figure out where you went wrong. That eureka moment could save you a lot of stress.<br><br>
    <strong><em>PseudoCode:</strong></em><br>
    This starts with the general problem solving method of trying to think about the big picture and what you're doing. However, instead of diving straight into the content this method encourages you to write out how you would do the smaller steps of the larger problem. You don't actually need to solve the problems you just break them down to plain English small solutions, outlines like a rough draft. Working from those comments you start working from the smaller inner functions out. Realising that you made mistakes is fine since they are easy to correct and have low time investments with this method. Focusing on coding one thing at a time, is at ease allows programmers to not be bogged down by the bigger picture. Adding, modifying and correcting steps should be no hassle for a programmer using this.<br><br>Other methods which are quite intuitive and speak for themselves are:<br>
    <strong><em>Googling</strong></em><br>
    <strong><em>Trying anything - basically meaning don't give up and try an attempt.</strong></em><br>
    <strong><em>Asking your peers or coachs for help</strong></em><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Problem solving, in my opinion, is knowing what the best tool is for the job. All these methods are useful and depending on what type of debugging you need to do you should try different methods. But don't give up and if you do try again.
