	<p>
		The best way to highlight the differences between display: inline; vs display: inline-blocks; is to show it in action!

	<p id="pTagInline">
		<strong>This example has the property of <span style="color: #41B3A3;">"display: inline"</span>. Here we have two boxes: <span class="inline">Box 1</span> <span class="inline">Box 2</span> also here's some needless text after it.</strong> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
	</p

	<p class="differences">
		The noteable difference for the boxes above:<br>* You can not set a width or height to the elements. <br>* The top and bottom margins and paddings are ignored.
	</p><br>

	<p id="pTagInlineBlock">
		<strong>CSS's <span style="color: #41B3A3;">"display: inline-block"</span> however looks different. Here we have two boxes again: <span class="inlineBlock">Box 3</span> <span class="inlineBlock">Box 4</span> likewise followed by needless text.</strong> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.

	<p id="pTagBlock">
	<strong>CSS's <span style="color: #41B3A3;">"display: block"</span> just to understand further differences. Once again: <span class="block">Box 5</span> <span class="block">Box 6</span> followed by needless text.</strong> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.

	<p class="differences">
		Differences:<br>* Block has a linebreak after the element. <br>* This results in the elements not being able to sit side by side.
