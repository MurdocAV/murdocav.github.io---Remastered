		My strengths and limitations are mainly based on content that I'm not familiar with yet. I'm an active learner so time-management is my bestfriend. Though sometimes it feels more like an enemy ðŸ˜ .

		Routine and structure, and ensuring to improve on sticking to a schedule is my main way to combat having a dense workload like this course. Working with others in a productive manner requires having manners, respect and effective concise communication. I believe that it's essentail to be able to get along with peers if you are to be sucessful in any field.

		For me the hardest part about asking for help is the initial act. I don't want to impose an issue as a demand. Friendliness is a good way  that I have found to combat this problem, if someone seems agitated I often will either offer help if it's a reasonable solution or leave that person alone.

		So far I have discovered that whenever I need to seek help, I will work through a mental process. Firstly if I can't get help from Mr Google, I change my approach to learning about the topic. If I still can't understand it  I will see if I can contact someone for help. The facilitators at EDA are pretty helpful, always happy to lend a hand, with a bredth of knowledge on the topics. My learning journey has highlighted that without a doubt you will get stuck. It's what you do when you're stuck that makes the difference.

		My friends are my whanau I've had a lot of friends who I can rely on for help who I've known for 8+ years. They will try their best to work through the process if I get stuck. Following from that they're also an important commitment for me, I dedicate time in everyday to being able to either socialize or wind down. I have found that you can't (unless you're superman) get through all the content without breaks. It's important, essential, to come at the problem with a fresh set of eyes to gain insight that you did not have previously.
