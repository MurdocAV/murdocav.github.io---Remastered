	<h2>Summary of Core Content</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Thinking like a programmer: </strong><br><br> Problem solving is the default mode of looking at any situation as a programmer. 
		How you plan on understanding the problem and planning how you approach and get answers is vital.<br><strong>How do you break down large complex problems?</strong>
	</p><br>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Your Identity and Values: </strong><br><br> I'm committed to saying that commitment is a fundamental core value that I need to
		improve on in order to become successful at anything. Curiosity was the initial value that brought me in to programming, but I would now say
		that structure and habit is taking a more important role in my learning now. <br><strong>"Stay foolish, Stay Hungry".</strong>
	</p><br>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Emotional Intelligence: </strong><br><br>This one is a time-sink, like JavaScript. There's a lot of room for improvement,
		enough for the rest of your life. EQ/EI can be improved at a much better rate than your intelligence. The ability to be aware, present,
		mindful of your emotions and other's emotions is vital. Use that information to guide your own actions.<br>You can improve it by practicing the following:
		<br><span class="smlTitles"><em>Attention Training: </em></span>Train yourself to have more awareness of your emotions and how you can easier come to a calm,
		clear and alert mind.<br><em><span class="smlTitles">Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery: </span></em> Understanding yourself and what's going on with you can better
		help you regulate emotions and mastery over control over those emotions. You can figure out the intensity of your emotion and regulate it. Increasing knowledge of
		yourself leads to mastery.<br><em><span class="smlTitles">Creating Useful Mental Habits: </span></em> This is a big one that I'm focusing on, habits are like
		a function code that helps you automatically regulate your behaviours and the following emotions. If you believe you can't do something rather than focusing on that,
		break down your problem. Make a plan of attack. Change how you would interact to a negative scenario and make little mental habits of how to improve on them. For social
		situations practice 'conscious listening'. Be present and mindful and jot down mental notes about the conversation.<br><strong>Improving your E.Q. will stop
		you from banging your head on a table.</strong>
	</p><br>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Neuroplasticy:</strong><br><br>This is an incredibly important concept to understand, even if it only serves as a kick in the back to continue working.
		It's your responsibility and this is science's way of saying put in more effort and get a better outcome. Your brain isn't hardwired to be at a certain skill set.
		Learning more increases connections with greater ability to recall content in the future. Practical practice is the best way to do this. Engaging content deeply and
		correcting errors are vital.<br><strong>Question your knowledge and improve on it.</strong>
	</p><br>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Growth Mindset: </strong><br><br>Following on from the learnings in Neuroplasticy. Improve and develop qualities through actions. Through effort
		and tough difficulty you learn. Don't give up and blame your scenario for your lack of improvement. If you start believing your abilities are fixed your
		following decisions will be a display of such a mindset. Don't run away from difficulty, "Grow". Enjoy your progress even if you're not at your desired goal
		<span class="smlTitles">'yet'.</span> Knowing that difficulty is when your brain makes the strongest connections can be encouragement for pushing through a difficult task.
		<br><strong>Let your inability to be the best wake you up in the morning. Don't let it keep you in bed.</strong>
	</p><br>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Personal Reflections: </strong><br><br> Personally while I absolutely hate looking at a block of work, thinking I'd never be able to finish it. 
		I have found that tasks are often no where near as bad as I thought to complete. If the task is too hard to tackle, taking breaks is a good way to clear your head and stay present.
		If I found myself in a problem that occurred too often, i.e.(Not putting in a ';') create useful habits that solve the problem occurring.
		My solution was to always check if I had a semicolon on every line, yes... even return. Continuing to improve beyond the level I'm currently at will be my next tough challenge 
		I'm heading into. Core skills are more important than technical, if you can't actually get the job there's no point being able to do the task.
