		<strong>Emotional Intelligence is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, 
		and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		This means to have a good sense of judgment and a ready comprehension of other people's states.
	</p><br>
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		<strong><em>More importantly, how can we improve our emotional intelligence?</strong></em>
	</p>

	<p class="hideInitailly">
		<strong>Attention Training:</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		Become aware of yourself, your body, your emotions, your presence. This can help you better organize your thoughts and attention.
	</p>
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		<strong>Self Knowledge & Mastery:</strong>
	</p>
			
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		Know what is occupying you internally, more importantly what is occupying your mind. This allows you to understand what's going on,
		allowing you to be more present (and hopefully better engage) in the situation.
	</p>
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		<strong>Creating Useful Mental Habits:</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		Habits are (almost) like functions! Usefully you can defend against what is known as
		the "Super Ego", the critical judging part of your mind. Defending against it while being present allows you to clearly
		see your strengths and weaknesses.
	</p><br>	
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		Emotional intelligence has been studied to be influential for a lot of positive traits. Daniel Goleman, goes on about it's impact and the results of his studies, in his 1996 book. 
		Goleman goes on to describes Emotional Intelligence. He found that many higher ups throughout society possessed a good grasp of skills that require emotional intelligence, furthermore he
		found that one can improve it to better themselves. In his experimental studies he found that emotional abilities influenced consumers when they were deciding to buy products.
		One would be foolish to dismiss this knowledge and not read more into it.
	</p>
	
	<p class="hideInitailly">
		Cultivating emotional intelligence requires one to interact with the world while holding the knowledge that they have skills that can be improved. Having a growth mindset with the idea that 
		our brains are like muscles that can be changed is vital. We find Neuroplasticity as a useful concept to promote this idea. You need discipline *or to train it* in order to improve your emotional intelligence skills.
		Those that weren't blessed with good role models can still learn it.
