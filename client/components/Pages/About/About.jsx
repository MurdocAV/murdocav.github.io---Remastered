                    I have found that tasks are often no where near as bad as I thought to complete. If the task is too hard \
                    to tackle, taking breaks is a good way to clear your head and stay present. If I found myself in a \
                    problem that occurred too often, i.e. Not putting in a ';', creating useful habits that solve the problem \
                    from occuring would be my solution. \
                    Continuing to improve beyond the level I'm currently at will be my next tough challenge I'm \
                    heading into. Core skills are more important than technical, if you can't actually get the job \
                    there's no point being able to do the task."
