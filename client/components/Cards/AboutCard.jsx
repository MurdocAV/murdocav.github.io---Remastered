        We are constantly being changed by our experiences. You aren't hardwired to be specifically smart at a
        set skill when you're born. Pracitce, engaging cognitively, improving your skills is vital. Put the
        information you're learning in context with other informatino you already possess, build a foundation of
        knowledge. Abilities are developed through effort and difficulty. Talents are not fixed, not giving up easily.
        Practice, be patient, learn from mistakes. I'm not there yet.
