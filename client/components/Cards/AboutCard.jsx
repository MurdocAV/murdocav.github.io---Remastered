        <strong className="strongTag">Strengths and Limitations</strong>
        <br/>
        My strengths are based on content that I'm not familiar with yet. I enjoy being an active learner so time-management
        would be a big important technique in order to make sure it's a strength and not a limitation.
        <br/>
        <strong className="strongTag">Routine and Structure</strong>
        <br/>
        Working with others productively requires having manners, respect and effective concise communication.
        I believe it's essentail to be able to get along with your peers if you are to be sucessful in any field.
        <br/>
        <strong className="strongTag">Getting Unstuck</strong>
        <br/>
        When it comes to asking for help, I don't like imposing an issue as a demand. Friendliness is a good way
        to combat this problem. If someone seems agitated either offer a reasonable solution or leave that
        person alone.
        <br/>
        <strong className="strongTag">Winding down</strong>
        <br/>
        Friends and family are an important commitment for me, needing dedicated time to outside work. I have
        found that you can't get through all the content without breaks. It's important, essential to come at the
        problem with a fresh set of eyes to gain insight that you didn't have previously.
        <br/>
        <strong className="strongTag">Attention and Emotional Intelligence</strong>
        <br/>
        Being able to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions is a great skill. You need to handle
        interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. To do this I find it helpful to be aware of
        yourself, your body, your emotions, your presence. This can help you better organize your thoughts and
        attention.
        <br/>
        <strong className="strongTag">Learning</strong>
        <br/>
        We are constantly being changed by our experiences. You aren't hardwired to be specifically smart at a
        set skill when you're born. Pracitce, engaging cognitively, improving your skills is vital. Put the
        information you're learning in context with other informatino you already possess, build a foundation of
        knowledge. Abilities are developed through effort and difficulty. Talents are not fixed, not giving up easily.
        Practice, be patient, learn from mistakes. I'm not there yet.
